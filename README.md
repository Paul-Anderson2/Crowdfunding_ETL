Repository for storing files and folders for Project 2 Crowdfunding ETL
The original contacts.xlsx file had an error. Deleting row 3 seemed to fix the error. It was a blank row            


Part 1 notes : Option 1, using Pandas to create the contacts DataFrame, was employed.                   
Starter code for option 2 was deleted to avoid any confusion                          
Code for this section in the ipynb file

Resources in the 'resources folder' include :                          
Two Excel files originally provided and used as raw data in the Jupyter notebook code                  
Four csv files generated in the Jupyter Notebook code, transformed, and then used in the                 
tables generated for the SQL database 'crowdfunding.db'                  

In the 'screenshots' folder, there are screenshots for each of the tables in the SQL db,           
demonstrating that the tables were properly formatted and populated with the data
